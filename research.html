    <h1>Research Overview</h1>
    <p class="research-text">
      I am a Master’s student in Artificial Intelligence at IIT Delhi, with research interests spanning
      <strong>Natural Language Processing, Graph Machine Learninig Vision-Language Systems</strong>.
      I am currently working in the domain of AI for Science, focusing on developing a Vision-Language model for 
      the applications on Material Science.
     
    </p>

    <!-- <p class="research-text">
      I have worked on structured prediction models such as <strong>CRF and BiLSTM-CRF</strong>,
      parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models using <strong>LoRA/PEFT</strong>,
      and vision-based detection systems including <strong>Deformable DETR</strong> and
      <strong>Grounding DINO</strong>.
    </p>

    <p class="research-text">
      My recent research explores <strong>intent-controlled counterspeech generation</strong>
      and <strong>algorithmic recourse</strong>, with the goal of designing socially responsible
      and actionable AI systems.

      <h2>Intent-Controlled Counterspeech Generation</h2>
      <p>
        Designed a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline using PEFT (LoRA) on T5 and GPT-2 models to
        generate counterspeech conditioned on intent labels. Evaluated using BLEU and ROUGE.

      <h2>Structured Prediction with CRF Models</h2>
      <p>
        Implemented Linear CRF and BiLSTM-CRF models from scratch without autograd, including
        forward-backward and Viterbi decoding, for Named Entity Recognition tasks.

      <h2>Vision-Language Object Detection</h2>
      <p>
        Fine-tuned Grounding DINO and Deformable DETR models for object detection tasks and
        evaluated performance using COCO-style mAP metrics.

  <h1 class="title">SPARK OF BUSINESS</h1>

      <p>Rubbing two quartz results in a spark, and often reading business magazines or studying 
    biographies leads to a spark too. A spark, an idea is useless without fuel and a correct 
    environment. We all heard that all it takes to form a successful business is a good idea, but 
    it is incorrect. A good idea is a necessity. A company cannot be successful if its very 
    foundation is rotten. But at the same time, a good foundation is useless without labor, hard 
    work, and the necessary materials required to finish a building.
    </p>

      A lucrative company must have a product that is unique and more efficient than its 
      competition. Along with having a good marketing and sales strategy to help sustain the 
      product for long in the market. Without a successful marketing strategy, 
      the product will fail. While even a mediocre product can be a hit if we 
      market it right. The first step to start a formal business is to write 
      down a business plan to get legal authorization. A business plan 
      would also help you in pitching your idea to the investors and 
      lenders, along with thinking of multiple ways to generate revenue.
      <br>
    <br>
    A business plan is a draft that carries your vision 
    on paper. It should cover all the assurances 
    and threats that could affect your 
    business and have different sections to facilitate your work. It 
    must include an overview of 
    your business, the product, 
    and the industry background.
    <br>
    <br>
    As a business owner, one 
    should have updated 
    knowledge of the market like 
    the trends, the requirements, 
    etc. The individual must try to 
    focus on a defined market.</p>

      <p>Having a defined plan of 
        business makes it easier to 
        raise funds. Most people 
        often underestimate the time 
        and expenses needed to keep 
        their business on track.
        <br>
        <br>
        Once the business plan is ready, a 
        business owner must experiment with it. Showcasing the product in the market and asking for 
        customer feedback is crucial as it helps knowing if 
        there is room for improvement.
        <br>
        <br>
        The responses shall help in imagining the future of 
        the product in the life of consumers. Negative feedback should always be 
        taken as an opportunity to improve the product and offer better quality. 
        Updating the product based on customer reviews also increases the 
        chances of sustaining longer.
        <br>
        <br>
        After being equipped with a working business plan and valuable customer 
        feedback, the next step is to approach investors to prove your concept and 
        eventually raise capital. It may take months to get any investment. Investors do hesitate to 
        invest in a business without any noticing proof. One should always make sure to make their 
        business profile easily visible to the market as it helps to impact the customer's mind, which 
        could lead to mouth publicity.

        Once the business is running successfully, one should always be within the legal 
        authorization of the government to avoid any future collapse. Violating laws leads to a 
        negative impact on the brand name, this often leads to a decrease in product value. 
        Customers having a negative perspective will decrease the demand. Also, when bringing any 
        investor or partner, it should be done through a government-defined system and 
        signing a contract.

  </div>
  <p class="text-white px-5 py-2">The first spark in quantum computing was ignited in 1981 by 
    the  famous  physicist  and  MIT  professor  Richard  Fayman.  He  
    proposed  his  research  paper,  “Classical  computers  cannot  
    simulate the evolution of quantum systems efficiently". With 
    this paper, he proposed a quantum computer model,                      
    theoretically, which is capable of such type of simulations. 
    Quantum computers harness the behavior of quantum physics and 
    apply it to the field of computation. It accounts for the 
    properties of atomic and subatomic particles.</p>
    <p class="text-white px-5 py-2">
    Quantum computers can create vast multidimensional spaces to 
    represent  very  large  problems.  Algorithms  that  employ                     
    quantum wave interference are then used to find solutions in 
    this  space  and  translate  them  into  forms  we  can  use  and                   
    understand. Several Quantum Properties such as superposition 
    and entanglement make it different from classical computers 
    and  make  it  much  faster  than  any  classical  computer.                       
    Entanglement  is  important  in      quantum  cryptography  and             
    quantum communication.</p>

                The  first  application  is  cybersecurity  which  led  to  the     
                development in the field of quantum computing. Looking at the 
                present and the future, we can see that the world is moving 
                towards Artificial intelligence and machine learning, which 
                require  heavy  computation  and  optimization.  After  many       
                research  papers  were  published  on  the  topic  of  AI  and  ML

                    The most controversial application of QC is its potential 
                    for breaking public-key cryptography, specifically the RSA 
                    algorithm, which is at the heart of the nearly $4 trillion 
                    e-commerce industry. RSA relies on the fact that the product 
                    of  two  prime  numbers  is  computationally  challenging  to  
                    factor. It would take classical computers trillions of years 
                    to break RSA encryption. A quantum computer with around 4,000 
                    error-free  qubits  could  defeat  RSA  in  seconds.  Classified

                    a sufficiently powerful quantum computer becomes available.

            <p class="text-white">Quantum  Algorithms  is  an  algorithm  implemented  in  quantum  
            computers  to  perform  quantum  computation.  The  most  common  
            model used for computation is the quantum circuit model. Like 
            classical algorithms is a finite sequence of instructions or 
            step-by-step procedures where instructions are implemented 
            one  at  a  time.  The  quantum  algorithm  follows  the  same                       
            procedure, but quantum computers support parallelism, i.e., 
            multiple instructions can execute simultaneously.</p>

            The first major qc algorithm - In 1994, Peter Shor developed 
            his  algorithm  allowing  quantum  computers  to  efficiently     
            factorize large integers exponentially quicker than the best 
            classical algorithm on traditional machines. Theoretically, 
            the  Shor  algorithm  is  capable  of  breaking  many  of  the              
            cryptosystems  used  today.    The  possibility  to  break                      
            cryptosystems in hours rather than millions of years using 
            quantum  computers  lit  a  fire  of  interest  for  quantum                   
            computing and its applications.</p>
            <p class="text-white"> 
            How did Shor develop the first major qc algorithm - Peter 
            Shor was a student at Caltech, where Richard Feynmann was the 
            professor. In Feynman's lecture, he presented his paper on 
            negative probability. The idea for this paper came to him 
            first  after  viewing  Bell's  theorem,  which  stated  the  EPR   
            paradox. He tried to find in his writings, but he got into a 
            hidden assumption that probability lies between 0 & 1, which 
            made him release his papers on negative probability to prove 
            Bell's theorem wrong. However, it did not serve the purpose.
            In 1992, Umesh Vazirani presented his papers in Bell labs on 
            "Bernstein Vazirani Algorithm," which could work faster on 
            the quantum computer than the classical computer, which was 
            the first motivation for the shot to make an algorithm in the 
            field of quantum computing. Later in the Symposium on Theory 
            of  Computing  (STOC)  conference  ,  Simon  presented  his        
            algorithm, which the various researchers rejected. However, 
            Shor was motivated by solving Simon's problem that he decided 
            to  use  those  methods  to  solve  a  discrete  log  problem.  He    
            presented his work at the National institute of standards and 
            technology  (NIST)  conference  which  was  specifically  orga-
            nized to understand the factoring algorithm. In the next few 
            weeks, he solved the prime factorization problem with quantum 
            algorithms with the concepts used similarly in discrete log 
            problems. Finding the algorithm for the factorizing problem 
            brought him glory worldwide; since the old encryption system 
            works based on discrete log problems, modern-day encryptions 
            are possible using Shor's algorithm's help.</p>
